# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my first Java project while at Skill Distillery. This project is based on a simple cash register. The cashier will be shown a menu when the program is first run. Upon selecting sale, the cashier will be given the option to enter the cost of the item being purchased. They will then be prompted for how much tender is given. The program will correctly tell how much change is given back starting with the largest denomination The program will end when the sale is successful or the cashier chooses to logout.

## What I learned
This project helped me understand the importance of the numeral system in Java, specifically when it comes to rounding errors. I was initially not able to correctly display the amount of pennies given back. It took some calculations and understanding of exactly what was going wrong. To me, that was the hardest part of building the program. I now understand casting variables, invoking methods, as well as the argument and parameter concept.

## Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git.
